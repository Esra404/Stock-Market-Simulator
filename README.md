# Stock-Market-Simulator
Object Oriented Programming Mini-Project
### About
This repository contains the mini-project that was completed by myself for my Object Oriented programming modules during the second semester at university. 

It essentially simulates the increases and decreases in the stock market where the user is able to both buy and sell stocks. The user also has the option of viewing a graph, which provides a visual representation of the price changes for a particular stock. This funcion was implemented through the use of two Java class libraries; JCommon and JFreeChart. Both can be found in the External JAR folder.

## Installation
To execute the program, go into the dist folder and run the Stock_Market_Simulator.jar file. If running from Netbeans, a change will have to made to the path to the history (read the commented in StockMarketSimulator.java)
