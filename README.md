# Stock-Market-Simulator
Object Oriented Programming Mini-Project
### About
This repository contains the mini-project that was completed by myself for my Object Oriented programming module during the second semester at university. 

It essentially simulates the increases and decreases in the stock market where the user is able to both buy and sell stocks. The user also has the option of viewing a graph, which provides a visual representation of the price changes for a particular stock. This funcion was implemented through the use of two Java class libraries; JCommon and JFreeChart. Both can be found in the External JAR folder.

An incremental style of development was used, where more and more features were added on based on a given timeline.

## Installation
To execute the program, go into the dist folder and run the Stock_Market_Simulator.jar file. If running from Netbeans, a change will have to made to the path to the history (read the comments in StockMarketSimulator.java)

## Potential Upgrades

* Saving simulation so user can continue at later time or date
* Providing information about a particular stock to the user, such as the CEO of a company
* Instead of having "Buy/Sell", user can click on the stock name in the main window and to buy and click on the bought stock in the text area to sell
